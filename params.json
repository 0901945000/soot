{"name":"Soot","tagline":"Soot - A framework for analyzing and transforming Java and Android applications","body":"# What is Soot?\r\n\r\nSoot is a Java optimization framework. It provides four intermediate representations for analyzing and transforming Java bytecode:\r\n\r\n* Baf: a streamlined representation of bytecode which is simple to manipulate.\r\n* Jimple: a typed 3-address intermediate representation suitable for optimization.\r\n* Shimple: an SSA variation of Jimple.\r\n* Grimp: an aggregated version of Jimple suitable for decompilation and code inspection.\r\n\r\nSee http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/ for details.\r\n\r\n# How do I get started with Soot?\r\n\r\nWe have some documentation on Soot in the [wiki](https://github.com/Sable/soot/wiki) and also a large range of [tutorials](http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/tutorial/index.html) on Soot.\r\n\r\n# How do I obtain the nightly builds\r\n\r\n** Note that the nightly build server has moved**\r\n\r\nNightly builds of soot can be obtained from [nightly build](http://ssebuild.cased.de/nightly/soot/). The \"soot-trunk.jar\" file is an all-in-one file that also contains all the required libraries. The \"sootclasses-trunk.jar\" file contains only Soot, allowing you to use manually pick dependencies as you need them.\r\n\r\n# About Soot's source code\r\n\r\nSoot follows the git-flow convention. Releases and hotfixes are maintained in the master branch.\r\nDevelopment happens in the develop branch. To catch the bleeding edge of Soot, check out the latter.\r\nYou will also need the projects [jasmin](https://github.com/Sable/jasmin) and\r\n[heros](https://github.com/Sable/heros). In case of any questions, please consult the Soot\r\nmailing list at: http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/mailman/listinfo/soot-list/\r\n","google":"UA-53612145-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
